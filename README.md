> Optimal design of experiment, machine learning, Fisher information

This project provides
- convenient interfaces for designs of experiments, metrics to evaluate them, functions and statistical models
- a library for statistical models, designs of experimentsm and metrics
- in particular the pi-design
- a pipeline for benchmarking and comparing different designs for different scenarios
- jupyter notebooks to easily run and learn how to use this projects content

This project is closely related to (the paper) where the background and mathematical framework used here is explained in detail.

## Installing
