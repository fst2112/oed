> Optimal experimental design, machine learning, Fisher information

This project provides
- convenient interfaces for designs of experiments, metrics to evaluate them, functions and statistical models
- a library for statistical models, designs of experimentsm and metrics
- in particular the pi-design
- a pipeline for benchmarking and comparing different designs for different scenarios
- jupyter notebooks to easily run and learn how to use this projects content

This project is closely related to (the paper) where the background and mathematical framework used here is explained in detail.

## Installing 

Run in your terminal

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nicolaipalm/oed.git
cd oed/
```

Activate your favourite virtual environment and run 
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In order to set up a conda environment (recommended when working in jupyter notebooks) type in your terminal
```shell
conda create -n oed
conda activate oed
conda install pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting started

The easiest way in order to get familiar with this project is by checking out the notebooks.
Navigate to the notebooks sub-directory and follow the instructions given in the README.md.

Alternatively you can run the aging_model_pipeline.py file in the ./pipeline/aging_models subdirectory your favourite IDE.
